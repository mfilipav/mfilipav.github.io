title: "Epitope-Independent Purification of Native-Like Envelope Trimers from Diverse HIV-1 Isolates"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016hiv
excerpt: 'The production and purification of diverse soluble Env trimers that maintain native-like (NL) structure present technical chal- lenges that must be overcome in order to advance vaccine development and provide reagents for HIV research. Low levels of NL trimer expression amid heterogeneous Env conformers, even with the addition of stabilizing mutations, have presented a major challenge. In addition, it has been difficult to separate the NL trimers from these heterogeneous mixtures. While MAbs with specificity for quaternary NL trimer epitopes have provided one approach to purifying the desirable species, such methods are dependent on the Env displaying the proper epitope. In addition, MAb affinity chromatography can be expensive, the necessary MAb may be in limited supply, and large-scale purification may not be feasible. Our method based on biochemical separation techniques offers an epitope-independent approach to purification of NL trimers with general application to diverse Envs.'
